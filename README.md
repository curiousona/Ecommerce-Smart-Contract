# Ecommerce Smart Contract

## Overview
The Ecommerce Smart Contract is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to facilitate ecommerce transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functionality for registering products, purchasing products, confirming delivery, and contract destruction under certain conditions.

## Features
- **Product Registration**: Sellers can register their products for sale by providing details such as title, description, and price.
- **Purchase Products**: Buyers can purchase registered products by sending the exact amount of Ether specified by the seller.
- **Confirm Delivery**: Buyers can confirm delivery of purchased products, triggering the transfer of funds to the seller.
- **Contract Destruction**: The contract owner (manager) can destroy the contract and withdraw its balance, preventing further transactions.

## Usage
1. **Registering Products**: Sellers can register their products using the `registerProduct` function, providing the necessary details.
2. **Purchasing Products**: Buyers can purchase products using the `buy` function, ensuring they send the exact amount of Ether specified by the seller.
3. **Confirming Delivery**: Buyers can confirm delivery of purchased products using the `delivery` function.
4. **Contract Destruction**: The contract owner (manager) can destroy the contract using the `destroy` function under certain conditions.

## Security
- The contract ensures that it cannot be destroyed after certain conditions are met, enhancing security and preventing premature contract termination.
